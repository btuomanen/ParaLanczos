# ParaLanczos GPU Library Version 0.2
The purpose of this software library is to perform fast massively parallel eigenvalue computations of large quantities of comparably small non-singular submatrices within a much larger positive-symmetric matrix in CUDA;  notably, this library has been developed to assist in the study of Reduced Isometry Property (RIP) sensing matrices in the field of Compressive Sensing.  To this end, several Matlab front-ends are included, as well as standard command-line C examples.  This library was written entirely by Brian Tuomanen.
